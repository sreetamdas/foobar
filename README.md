## Overview

For a while, I had trouble following up on my side-projects so I rebuilt my website: I could now play around with pretty much everything.

The website is pretty minimal, and should hopefully provide a seamless experience. If you notice anything that you'd like to improve, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/sreetamdas/sreetamdas.com/issues/new) and/or send a pull request!

### The mini-game

If you don't know what I am referring to, that's great! You haven't discovered the mini-game yet. If you'd like to check it out, please open up the browser console on [sreetamdas.com](https://sreetamdas.com). 😉

You can check out some more details below ⬇️

Well, the cat's out of the bag: there's a mini-game on <a href="https://sreetamdas.com">sreetamdas.com</a>! If you're forking this repository for yourself, be aware that you will be forking that as well. 😅 It isn't a "module" as such that you can just remove from the website — though the game lies in the <code>/foobar</code> subdirectory.

Pretty much wherever the mini-game is present in the repo, it's placed under a <code>foobar</code> subfolder (eg. in <code>components</code>) so you'll know when you're about to come across mini-game related code. 😄
