## Hello there!

I'm Sreetam Das, thanks for checking out my website!

I'm currently a front-end engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com). I enjoy working on React and all things JavaScript/TypeScript, am a big believer in the functional programming paradigm â€” lately, I've been interested in learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I'm a self-taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) _(psst, my alma matter's was the first big website I worked on!)_. I've been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google for the first time.

In the past, I've worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and been responsible for python _and_ UI rewrites. I've continued working with React and TypeScript since then and love the experiece, along with a [bunch of other packages](/tooling) â€” I firmly believe in developer tooling which allows one to 1.1x developers. ðŸ˜‰

Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my college's [Quiz Club](https://www.facebook.com/qcnitw). Having played a lot of [CS](https://blog.counter-strike.net) in my childhood and college, I also love following the [CS:GO esports scene](https://www.hltv.org). I enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards) pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and podcasts and am always looking for more ways to consume information from around the world.

You can check me out on the following platforms:
